 * 
 * It is desirable that the main component of a simulation model, i.e. the
 * "simulation" block instance, should respond to the sequencing procedures of
 * 12.4 as if it were itself a process object. This is accomplished by having a
 * process object of the class MAIN_PROGRAM as a permanent component of the
 * quasi-parallel system.
 * <p>
 * The process object represents the main component with respect to the
 * sequencing procedures. Whenever it becomes operative, the PSC (and OSC)
 * immediately enter the main component as a result of the "detach" statement
 * (cf. 7.3.1). The procedure "current" references this process object whenever
 * the main component is active.
 * <p>
 * A simulation model is initialized by generating the MAIN_PROGRAM object and
 * scheduling an active phase for it at system time zero. Then the PSC proceeds
 * to the first user-defined statement of the "simulation" block.
