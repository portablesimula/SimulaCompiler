/**
 * The Text Object.
 * <p>
 * A text object is conceptually an instance of
 * 
 * <pre>
 *    class TEXTOBJ( SIZE, CONST); integer SIZE; boolean CONST;
 *    begin character array MAIN( 1:SIZE ); end;
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Any text value processed by the program is contained within a text frame,
 * i.e. a non-empty segment of the MAIN attribute of some TEXTOBJ instance, or
 * it is empty (i.e. notext). See 2.5.
 * <p>
 * Any non-empty sequence of consecutive elements of the array attribute MAIN
 * constitutes a text frame. More specifically, any text frame is completely
 * identified by the following information:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>a reference to the text object containing the frame,</li>
 * <li>the start position of the frame, being an ordinal number less than or
 * equal to SIZE,</li>
 * <li>the length of the frame.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * A frame which is completely contained by another frame is called a "subframe"
 * of that frame. The text frame associated with the entire array attribute MAIN
 * is called the "main frame" of the text object. All frames of the text object
 * are subframes of the main frame.
 * <p>
 * Note: A main frame is a subframe of no frame except itself.
 * <p>
 * The frames of a text object are either all constant or all variable, as
 * indicated by the attribute CONST. The value of this attribute remains fixed
 * throughout the lifetime of the text object. A constant main frame always
 * corresponds to a string (see 1.6).
 * <p>
 * The attribute SIZE is always positive and remains fixed throughout the
 * lifetime of a text object.
 * <p>
 * Note: The identifier TEXTOBJ and its three attribute identifiers are not
 * accessible to the user. Instead, properties of a text object are accessible
 * through text variables, using the dot notation.
 * <p>
 * Note: <b>In this implementation the characters in MAIN are indexed 0 through SIZE-1.</b>
