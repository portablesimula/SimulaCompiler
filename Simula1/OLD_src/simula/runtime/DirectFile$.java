	 * Direct File Locking
	 * <p>
	 * Procedure "lock" enables the program to get exclusive access to all or
	 * part of the file. The effect of a "lock" call while the file is locked
	 * ("LOCKED" is true) is that the previous lock is immediately released
	 * (prior to the new locking attempt).
	 * <p>
	 * The parameter "timelimit" is the (clock) time in seconds that is the
	 * maximum waiting time for the resource. If "timelimit" is less than or
	 * equal to zero, the procedure returns immediately without performing any
	 * actions upon the file.
	 * <p>
	 * The parameters "loc1" and "loc2" identify the part of the file to be
	 * locked, by giving the ordinal numbers of two external images (bytes). The
	 * program is given exclusive access to a part of the file which includes
	 * the requested region. If the two parameters are both zero, this implies
	 * locking the whole file. Otherwise, the size of the part of the file that
	 * is actually locked, is implementation-dependent; it may even include the
	 * entire file.
	 * <p>
	 * A return value of zero indicates a successful "lock" operation. The value
	 * -1 indicates that "timelimit" was exceeded (or was zero or negative). A
	 * negative value less than -1 indicates "lock" failure and its
	 * interpretation is implementation-defined.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * <pre>
	 * integer procedure lock(timelimit,loc1,loc2);
	 *                     real timelimit; integer loc1,loc2;

	 * must be open for reading (and possibly writing); false to request an
	 * exclusive lock, in which case this channel must be open for writing (and
